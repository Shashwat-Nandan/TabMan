# Icons for TabMan Extension

You need to add three icon files to this directory:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. Suggested design:
- Use a tab-related icon (like multiple rectangles or browser tabs)
- Use colors that match the extension theme (purple/blue gradient)
- Make sure the icons are clear and recognizable at different sizes
